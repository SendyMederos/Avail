<ins>User Story</ins>

As a student in search of support in the subject I am studying

I want to be able to form a group with peers of the same subject who are willing to help me through a problem or just provide support
I also want to be able to provide support to others when I feel particularly strong in a subject

So that I can continue to learn and grow through being helped as well as offering help

Avail is a peer to peer tutoring resource that brings students of all subjects together to learn and grow. Through our platform, students unite to provide support to fellow peers in pre-scheduled, small video conference groups. When seeking support, a student can request help from a single peer or a group of peers and has the option to allow others to "spectate", thus allowing more of their peers to learn as well. At Avail, we believe in the power of growing through teaching and what better way to do that than allowing students to push themselves to the edge of their comprehension by offering their help to a peer. We want Avail to be a platform of trust and confidence, creating a safe space for questions and discovery. You donâ€™t have to be an expert to be able to lend a hand and help someone overcome an educational obstacle. Whether you are a student struggling to comprehend subject matter, or simply have a quick question to get through a homework assignment, Avail is there to help. Need someone to proofread your paper before you turn it in? Set up a meeting with someone in your peer group who can give you a fresh set of eyes and point out things you may have overlooked. Want to run drills in a coding language you are learning and need a friend to live code with you? Set your availability and wait for someone to tag in. Any subject, any stage of learning, Avail is waiting to help find you the support you need.

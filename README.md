# Avail

## About
Avail is a peer to peer tutoring resource that brings students 
of all subjects together to learn and grow. Through our platform,
students unite to provide support to fellow peers in pre-scheduled,
small video conference groups. When seeking support, a student can 
request help from a single peer or a group of peers and has the option to 
allow others to "spectate", thus allowing more of their peers to learn as well.
At Avail, we believe in the power of growing through teaching and what better way
to do that than allowing students to push themselves to the edge of their comprehension 
by offering their help to a peer. We want Avail to be a platform of trust and confidence,
creating a safe space for questions and discovery. You don’t have to be an expert to be able
to lend a hand and help someone overcome an educational obstacle. Whether you are a student struggling 
to comprehend subject matter, or simply have a quick question to get through a homework assignment, 
Avail is there to help. Need someone to proofread your paper before you turn it in? Set up a meeting with
someone in your peer group who can give you a fresh set of eyes and point out things you may have overlooked.
Want to run drills in a coding language you are learning and need a friend to live code with you?
Set your availability and wait for someone to tag in. Any subject, any stage of learning, Avail is waiting to help find you the support you need.
